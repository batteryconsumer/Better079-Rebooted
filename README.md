# Better079-Rebooted
Its the Rebooted version of Better079!

> This plugin adds so many new abilities to SCP-079 for a more interesting funny gameplay or roleplaying experience. The added features will not interfere with roleplaying and give the subject unlimited possibilities. **The plugin is ready to work with Northwood API**
> 
#### With this plugin, SCP-079 will be able to:
- SCP-079 will be able to turn off the lights throughout the complex by sacrificing a certain amount of energy for this action using ``.overcharge time`` command.
- SCP-079 will now be able to protect itself from restarting generators using the ``.overload`` console command, which will instantly cause a spectacular power outage and turn off only those generators that are currently charging.
- SCP-079 will now be able to simulate some cassies with glitches using ``.simulate cassieid`` command. Custom cassies for play as SCP-079 should be added in config
- SCP-079 will be able to teleport to random or specified player using ``.find <playerName/playerId>`` to find specified player or ``.find`` without arguments to find random player.
- SCP-2176 will damage SCP-079. When SCP-2176 explodes in special rooms (rooms should be writed in config) SCP-079 lost all energy and gets critical camera system errors to ~6 seconds.
- This plugin allows you to set the initial Tier for SCP-079 or automatically issue any tier after any length of time.
- This plugin allows allied teams (alliance commands are set in the plugin) to copy SCP-079 and take it out of the facility, allowing SCP-079 to escape, and subsequently gaining additional powers for the entire team of the person who carried SCP-079 on the device. The main carrier with SCP-079 is the device of the Chaos Rebels, to start copying, you need to go to one of the rooms set in the config and enter the ``.copy`` command into the client console, and then wait for the copying process to complete and take the object through the escape zone of the game.
- In this update has been added remote admin command ``shutdown <playerId> <time>`` that will allow users with ``bpc.shutdown`` permission to lose SCP-079 signal for specified time (in seconds).
